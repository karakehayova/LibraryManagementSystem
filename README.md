# LibraryManagementSystem
To start the project in dev mode:

```
npm run start-dev-ui
npm run start-dev
```

```
cd api
npm run dev
```

An admin user should be created first, as only admin can register other users. Unauthenticated users can preview all the books in the library, see which of them are available and which taken. Registered users can preview all books, their personal data, they can also give like or dislike on a specific book. Admins create new users, update their profiles, add new books, delete books, they note if the book is borrowed by a specific user and than again when the book is returned.
